A reusable, formally verified risk engine for perpetual futures decentralized exchanges (perp DEXs) built on Solana. This module provides mathematical guarantees about fund safety even under oracle manipulation attacks.

## Core Innovation: PNL Warmup Protection

**The Problem:** In any perp DEX, oracle manipulation can allow attackers to extract value by creating artificial profits through manipulated price feeds.

**The Solution:** PNL warmup ensures that realized profits cannot be withdrawn instantly. Instead, they "warm up" over a time period T, during which any ADL (Auto-Deleveraging) events will haircut unwrapped PNL first, protecting user principal.

### Key Guarantee

> **If an attacker can manipulate the oracle for at most time T, and PNL requires time T to become withdrawable, then user principal is always safe.**

This allows us to formally verify that users can always withdraw `(principal - realized_losses)` from the system.

## Architecture

### Memory Layout

All data structures are laid out in a single contiguous memory chunk, suitable for a single Solana account:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ RiskEngine                          │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ - vault: u128                       │
│ - insurance_fund: InsuranceFund     │
│ - users: Vec<UserAccount>           │
│ - lps: Vec<LPAccount>               │
│ - params: RiskParams                │
│ - current_slot: u64                 │
│ - fee_index: u128                   │
│ - sum_vested_pos_pnl: u128          │
│ - loss_accum: u128                  │
│ - fee_carry: u128                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Core Data Structures

#### UserAccount
```rust
pub struct UserAccount {
    pub principal: u128,           // NEVER reduced by ADL (Invariant I1)
    pub pnl_ledger: i128,          // Realized PNL (+ or -)
    pub reserved_pnl: u128,        // Pending withdrawals
    pub warmup_state: Warmup,      // PNL vesting state
    pub position_size: i128,       // Current position
    pub entry_price: u64,          // Entry price
    // ... fee tracking fields
}
```

#### LPAccount
```rust
pub struct LPAccount {
    pub matching_engine_program: [u8; 32],    // Program ID
    pub matching_engine_context: [u8; 32],    // Context account
    pub lp_capital: u128,                      // LP deposits
    pub lp_pnl: i128,                          // LP PNL
    pub lp_position_size: i128,                // LP position
    pub lp_entry_price: u64,                   // LP entry
}
```

#### InsuranceFund
```rust
pub struct InsuranceFund {
    pub balance: u128,              // Current balance
    pub fee_revenue: u128,          // Accumulated trading fees
    pub liquidation_revenue: u128,  // Accumulated liquidation fees
}
```

## Operations

### 1. Trading

**Pluggable Matching Engines:** Order matching is delegated to separate programs via CPI (Cross-Program Invocation). Each LP account specifies its matching engine program.

```rust
pub fn execute_trade(
    &mut self,
    lp_index: usize,              // LP providing liquidity
    user_index: usize,            // User trading
    oracle_price: u64,            // Oracle price
    size: i128,                   // Position size (+ long, - short)
    user_signature: &[u8],        // User authorization
) -> Result<()>
```

**Process:**
1. Verify user signature authorized the trade
2. CPI into matching engine program to execute trade
3. Apply trading fee → insurance fund
4. Update LP and user positions
5. Realize PNL if reducing position
6. Abort if either account becomes undercollateralized

**Safety:** No whitelist needed for matching engines because:
- User signature required for all trades
- Both LP and user must remain solvent (checked)
- Fees flow to insurance fund
- PNL changes are zero-sum between LP and user

### 2. Deposits & Withdrawals

#### Deposit
```rust
pub fn deposit(&mut self, user_index: usize, amount: u128) -> Result<()>
```
- Always allowed
- Increases `principal` and `vault`
- Preserves conservation

#### Withdraw Principal
```rust
pub fn withdraw_principal(&mut self, user_index: usize, amount: u128) -> Result<()>
```
- Allowed up to `principal` balance
- Must maintain margin requirements if user has position
- Never touches PNL

#### Withdraw PNL
```rust
pub fn withdraw_pnl(&mut self, user_index: usize, amount: u128) -> Result<()>
```
- Only warmed-up PNL can be withdrawn
- Limited by insurance fund balance
- Requires PNL to have vested over time T

### 3. PNL Warmup

```rust
pub fn withdrawable_pnl(&self, user: &UserAccount) -> u128
```

**Formula:**
```
withdrawable = min(
    positive_pnl - reserved_pnl,
    slope_per_step × elapsed_slots
)
```

**Properties:**
- **Deterministic:** Same inputs always yield same output
- **Monotonic:** Withdrawable PNL never decreases over time
- **Bounded:** Never exceeds available positive PNL

**Invariants (Formally Verified):**
- I5: PNL warmup is deterministic
- I5+: PNL warmup is monotonically increasing
- I5++: Withdrawable PNL ≤ available PNL

### 4. ADL (Auto-Deleveraging)

```rust
pub fn apply_adl(&mut self, total_loss: u128) -> Result<()>
```

**Process:**
1. **Phase 1:** Haircut unwrapped PNL first
   - Iterate through users
   - Calculate `unwrapped_pnl = positive_pnl - withdrawable - reserved`
   - Reduce `pnl_ledger` by haircut amount
   - **Principal is NEVER touched** (Invariant I1)

2. **Phase 2:** Apply remaining loss to insurance fund
   - If insurance insufficient, record in `loss_accum`

**Example:**
```
User has:
- principal: 10,000
- pnl_ledger: 5,000
- withdrawable (warmed up): 1,000
- reserved: 500

ADL loss: 4,000

Unwrapped PNL = 5,000 - 1,000 - 500 = 3,500
Haircut = min(3,500, 4,000) = 3,500 from PNL
Remaining = 4,000 - 3,500 = 500 from insurance

Result:
- principal: 10,000 (unchanged!)
- pnl_ledger: 1,500
- insurance: -500
```

**Formal Guarantees:**
- I1: User principal NEVER reduced by ADL
- I4: ADL haircuts unwrapped PNL before touching insurance
- I2: Conservation maintained throughout

### 5. Liquidations

```rust
pub fn liquidate_user(
    &mut self,
    user_index: usize,
    keeper_account: usize,
    oracle_price: u64,
) -> Result<()>
```

**Process:**
1. Check if user is below maintenance margin
2. If yes, close position (or reduce to safe size)
3. Realize PNL from position closure
4. Calculate liquidation fee
5. Split fee: 50% insurance fund, 50% keeper

**Maintenance Margin Check:**
```
collateral = principal + max(0, pnl_ledger)
position_value = abs(position_size) × oracle_price
margin_required = position_value × maintenance_margin_bps / 10,000

is_safe = collateral >= margin_required
```

**Safety:**
- Permissionless (no signature needed)
- Only affects undercollateralized accounts
- Keeper receives fee (incentive to call)
- Insurance fund builds reserves

## Formal Verification

    liquidation_fee_bps: 50,         // 0.5%
    insurance_fee_share_bps: 5000,   // 50% to insurance
};

let mut engine = RiskEngine::new(params);

// Add users and LPs
let alice = engine.add_user();
let lp = engine.add_lp(matching_program_id, matching_context);

// Alice deposits
engine.deposit(alice, 10_000)?;

// Alice trades (via matching engine)
engine.execute_trade(lp, alice, 1_000_000, 100, &signature)?;

// Time passes...
engine.advance_slot(50);

// Alice can withdraw some PNL (50 slots × slope)
let withdrawable = engine.withdrawable_pnl(&engine.users[alice]);
engine.withdraw_pnl(alice, withdrawable)?;

// Liquidations (permissionless)
let keeper = engine.add_user();
engine.liquidate_user(alice, keeper, oracle_price)?;
```

## Design Rationale

### Why PNL Warmup?

Traditional perp DEXs face an impossible tradeoff:
1. **Fast withdrawals** → vulnerable to oracle attacks
2. **Delayed withdrawals** → poor UX

PNL warmup solves this by:
- Allowing instant withdrawal of **principal** (users can always exit with their deposits)
- Requiring time for **PNL** to vest (prevents instant extraction of manipulated profits)
- Using ADL to haircut young PNL during crises (aligns incentives)

### Why Principal is Sacred?

By guaranteeing that `principal` is never touched by socialization:
1. Users can **always** withdraw their deposits (minus realized losses)
2. The worst case is losing unrealized PNL, not deposits
3. Creates clear mental model: "deposits are safe, profits take time"

### Why Pluggable Matching Engines?

Different trading styles need different matching:
- **CLOB** (Central Limit Order Book): Traditional exchange UX
- **AMM** (Automated Market Maker): Instant execution
- **RFQ** (Request for Quote): OTC/large trades
- **Auction**: Fair price discovery

By separating matching from risk:
1. Risk engine focuses on safety
2. Matching engines focus on price discovery
3. LPs can choose their preferred matching model
4. No need to trust/whitelist matching engines (safety checks in place)

## Safety Properties

### What This Guarantees

✅ **User principal is always withdrawable** (minus realized losses)
✅ **PNL requires time T to become withdrawable**
✅ **ADL haircuts young PNL first, protecting principal**
✅ **Conservation of funds across all operations**
✅ **User isolation - one user can't affect another**
✅ **No oracle manipulation can extract funds faster than time T**

### What This Does NOT Guarantee

❌ **Oracle is correct** (garbage in, garbage out)
❌ **Matching engine is fair** (LPs choose their matching engine)
❌ **Insurance fund is always solvent** (can be depleted in crisis)
❌ **Profits are guaranteed** (trading is risky!)

### Attack Resistance

| Attack Vector | Protection Mechanism |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Oracle manipulation | PNL warmup (time T) |
| Flash price attacks | Unrealized PNL not withdrawable |
| ADL abuse | Principal never touched |
| Matching engine exploit | User signature + solvency checks |
| Liquidation griefing | Permissionless + keeper incentives |
| Insurance drain | Fees replenish fund |
