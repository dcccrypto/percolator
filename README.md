While the code includes formal verification proofs and comprehensive testing, it has not been independently audited for production use. Use at your own risk.

A reusable, formally verified risk engine for perpetual futures decentralized exchanges (perp DEXs) built on Solana. This module provides mathematical guarantees about fund safety even under oracle manipulation attacks.

## Core Innovation: PNL Warmup Protection

**The Problem:** In any perp DEX, oracle manipulation can allow attackers to extract value by creating artificial profits through manipulated price feeds.

**The Solution:** PNL warmup ensures that realized profits cannot be withdrawn instantly. Instead, they "warm up" over a time period T, during which any ADL (Auto-Deleveraging) events will haircut unwrapped PNL first, protecting user principal.

### Key Guarantee

> **If an attacker can manipulate the oracle for at most time T, and PNL requires time T to become withdrawable, then user principal is always safe.**

This allows us to formally verify that users can always withdraw their principal from the system (subject to margin requirements if they have an open position).

## Architecture

### Memory Layout

All data structures are laid out in a single contiguous memory chunk, suitable for a single Solana account:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ RiskEngine                          │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ - vault: u128                       │

### Core Data Structures

#### UserAccount
```rust
pub struct UserAccount {
    pub principal: u128,           // NEVER reduced by ADL (Invariant I1)
    pub pnl_ledger: i128,          // Realized PNL (+ or -)
    pub reserved_pnl: u128,        // Pending withdrawals
    pub warmup_state: Warmup,      // PNL vesting state
    pub position_size: i128,       // Current position
    pub entry_price: u64,          // Entry price
    pub funding_index_user: i128,  // Funding index snapshot
    // ... fee tracking fields
}
```

#### LPAccount
```rust
pub struct LPAccount {
    pub matching_engine_program: [u8; 32],    // Program ID
    pub matching_engine_context: [u8; 32],    // Context account
    pub lp_capital: u128,                      // LP deposits
    pub lp_pnl: i128,                          // LP PNL
    pub lp_reserved_pnl: u128,                 // Reserved LP PNL
    pub lp_warmup_state: Warmup,               // LP PNL warmup
    pub lp_position_size: i128,                // LP position
    pub lp_entry_price: u64,                   // LP entry
    pub funding_index_lp: i128,                // Funding index snapshot
}
```

#### InsuranceFund
```rust
pub struct InsuranceFund {
    pub balance: u128,              // Current balance
    pub fee_revenue: u128,          // Accumulated trading fees
    pub liquidation_revenue: u128,  // Accumulated liquidation fees
}
```

## Operations

### 1. Trading

**Pluggable Matching Engines:** Order matching is delegated to separate programs via CPI (Cross-Program Invocation). Each LP account specifies its matching engine program.

```rust
pub fn execute_trade<M: MatchingEngine>(
    &mut self,
    matcher: &M,                  // Matching engine implementation
    lp_index: usize,              // LP providing liquidity
    user_index: usize,            // User trading
    oracle_price: u64,            // Oracle price
    size: i128,                   // Position size (+ long, - short)
) -> Result<()>
```

**Process:**
1. Settle funding for both user and LP (via `touch_user()`/`touch_lp()`)
2. Call matching engine to validate/execute trade
3. Apply trading fee → insurance fund
4. Update LP and user positions
5. Realize PNL if reducing position
6. Abort if either account becomes undercollateralized

**Safety:** No whitelist needed for matching engines because:
- Matching engine validates trade authorization (implementation-specific)
- Both LP and user must remain solvent (checked by risk engine)
- Fees flow to insurance fund
- PNL changes are zero-sum between LP and user
- Funding settled before position changes

### 2. Deposits & Withdrawals

#### Deposit
```rust
pub fn deposit(&mut self, user_index: usize, amount: u128) -> Result<()>
```
- Always allowed
- Increases `principal` and `vault`
- Preserves conservation

#### Withdraw
```rust
pub fn withdraw(&mut self, user_index: usize, amount: u128) -> Result<()>
```

Unified withdrawal function that handles both principal and PNL:

**Process:**
1. Settle funding (via `touch_user()`)
2. Convert warmed-up PNL to principal
3. Withdraw requested amount from principal
4. Ensure margin requirements maintained if user has open position

**Key Properties:**
- Withdrawable = principal + warmed_up_pnl - margin_required
- Automatically converts vested PNL to principal before withdrawal
- Must maintain initial margin if position is open
- Never allows withdrawal below margin requirements

### 3. PNL Warmup

```rust
pub fn withdrawable_pnl(&self, user: &UserAccount) -> u128
```

**Formula:**
```
withdrawable = min(
    positive_pnl - reserved_pnl,
    slope_per_step × elapsed_slots
)
```

**Properties:**
- **Deterministic:** Same inputs always yield same output
- **Monotonic:** Withdrawable PNL never decreases over time
- **Bounded:** Never exceeds available positive PNL

**Invariants (Formally Verified):**
- I5: PNL warmup is deterministic
- I5+: PNL warmup is monotonically increasing
- I5++: Withdrawable PNL ≤ available PNL

#### Warmup Rate Limiting

The system enforces a global cap on how fast PNL can warm up across all users, preventing the insurance fund from being overwhelmed:

**Invariant I9** (Formally Verified):
```
total_warmup_rate × (T/2) ≤ insurance_fund × max_warmup_rate_fraction_bps / 10_000
```

Where:
- `total_warmup_rate` = sum of all users' `slope_per_step` values
- `T` = `warmup_period_slots`
- `max_warmup_rate_fraction_bps` = configurable parameter (e.g., 5000 = 50%)

**How It Works:**

1. **Dynamic Slope Calculation:** When a user's PNL changes (via trading or liquidation), `update_warmup_slope()` recalculates their warmup slope:
   ```rust
   desired_slope = positive_pnl / warmup_period_slots
   ```

2. **Capacity Check:** The system checks if adding this slope would exceed the global limit:
   ```rust
   max_total_rate = insurance_fund × max_warmup_rate_fraction_bps / (warmup_period_slots / 2) / 10_000
   ```

3. **Graceful Degradation:** If capacity is exceeded, the slope is clamped to available capacity:
   ```rust
   actual_slope = min(desired_slope, available_capacity)
   ```

**Example:**
- Insurance fund = 10,000 USDC
- `max_warmup_rate_fraction_bps` = 5000 (50%)
- Warmup period T = 100 slots
- **Result:** Maximum 100 USDC can warm up per slot across all users
- In T/2 = 50 slots, at most 5,000 USDC warms up (50% of insurance fund)

**Benefits:**
- **Insurance Fund Protection:** Limits exposure during oracle manipulation attacks
- **Fair Capacity Allocation:** Users share warmup capacity proportionally to their PNL
- **No Rejections:** Uses graceful degradation instead of failing transactions
- **Dynamic Scaling:** Warmup capacity scales automatically with insurance fund size

**Security Property:**
Combined with ADL's unwrapped PNL haircutting (I4), this ensures that even during sustained oracle manipulation, the maximum loss to the insurance fund is bounded by `max_warmup_rate_fraction_bps` over the manipulation window.

### 4. ADL (Auto-Deleveraging)

```rust
pub fn apply_adl(&mut self, total_loss: u128) -> Result<()>
```

**Process:**
1. **Phase 1:** Haircut unwrapped PNL first
   - Iterate through users
   - Calculate `unwrapped_pnl = positive_pnl - withdrawable - reserved`
   - Reduce `pnl_ledger` by haircut amount
   - **Principal is NEVER touched** (Invariant I1)

2. **Phase 2:** Apply remaining loss to insurance fund
   - If insurance insufficient, record in `loss_accum`

**Example:**
```
User has:
- principal: 10,000
- pnl_ledger: 5,000
- withdrawable (warmed up): 1,000
- reserved: 500

ADL loss: 4,000

Unwrapped PNL = 5,000 - 1,000 - 500 = 3,500
Haircut = min(3,500, 4,000) = 3,500 from PNL
Remaining = 4,000 - 3,500 = 500 from insurance

Result:
- principal: 10,000 (unchanged!)
- pnl_ledger: 1,500
- insurance: -500
```

**Formal Guarantees:**
- I1: User principal NEVER reduced by ADL
- I4: ADL haircuts unwrapped PNL before touching insurance
- I2: Conservation maintained throughout

### 5. Liquidations

```rust
pub fn liquidate_user(
    &mut self,
    user_index: usize,
    keeper_account: usize,
    oracle_price: u64,
) -> Result<()>
```

**Process:**
1. Check if user is below maintenance margin
2. If yes, close position (or reduce to safe size)
3. Realize PNL from position closure
4. Calculate liquidation fee
5. Split fee: 50% insurance fund, 50% keeper

**Maintenance Margin Check:**
```
collateral = principal + max(0, pnl_ledger)
position_value = abs(position_size) × oracle_price
margin_required = position_value × maintenance_margin_bps / 10,000

is_safe = collateral >= margin_required
```

**Safety:**
- Permissionless (no signature needed)
- Only affects undercollateralized accounts
- Keeper receives fee (incentive to call)
- Insurance fund builds reserves

### 6. Withdrawal-Only Mode (Fair Unwinding)

When the insurance fund is depleted and losses exceed what can be covered (`loss_accum > 0`), the system automatically enters **withdrawal-only mode** - a controlled shutdown mechanism that ensures fair unwinding for all participants.

```rust
pub fn apply_adl(&mut self, total_loss: u128) -> Result<()>
```

**Trigger Condition:**
When ADL Phase 2 depletes the insurance fund, `withdrawal_only` flag is set:
```rust
if self.insurance_fund.balance < remaining_loss {
    // Insurance fund depleted - crisis mode
    self.loss_accum = remaining_loss - insurance_fund.balance;
    self.withdrawal_only = true;  // Enter controlled shutdown
}
```

#### Fair Unwinding Mechanism

**Key Property: Constant Haircut Ratio**

All withdrawals receive the same proportional haircut regardless of withdrawal order:

```
haircut_ratio = (total_principal - loss_accum) / total_principal
actual_withdrawal = requested_amount × haircut_ratio
```

**Example:**
- Total principal: 40,000 USDC (across all users)
- Loss accumulated: 10,000 USDC
- Available: 30,000 USDC
- **Haircut ratio: 75% for EVERYONE**

```
User A deposits: 10,000 → withdraws 7,500 (75%)
User B deposits: 20,000 → withdraws 15,000 (75%)
User C deposits: 10,000 → withdraws 7,500 (75%)
Total withdrawn: 30,000 (exactly the available amount)
```

**Implementation Detail:**

To maintain a constant haircut ratio despite changing principal amounts, the system tracks withdrawn amounts:

```rust
// Include already-withdrawn amounts in haircut calculation
let current_principal = users.iter().map(|u| u.principal).sum();
let total_principal = current_principal + withdrawal_mode_withdrawn;

// Everyone gets same ratio
let haircut_ratio = (total_principal - loss_accum) / total_principal;
```

This prevents "run on the bank" dynamics where early withdrawers get better rates.

#### Restrictions in Withdrawal-Only Mode

**Blocked Operations:**
- ❌ Opening new positions
- ❌ Increasing existing positions

**Allowed Operations:**
- ✅ Closing positions (users can unwind)
- ✅ Reducing positions
- ✅ User deposits (take on proportional loss)
- ✅ Withdrawals (with proportional haircut)
- ✅ Insurance fund top-ups

**Position Management:**
```rust
// In withdrawal_only mode, only allow reducing positions
if new_position.abs() > current_position.abs() {
    return Err(RiskError::WithdrawalOnlyMode);
}
```

This allows orderly unwinding while preventing new risk-taking.

#### Recovery Path: Insurance Fund Top-Up

Anyone can contribute to the insurance fund to cover losses and restore normal operations:

```rust
pub fn top_up_insurance_fund(&mut self, amount: u128) -> Result<bool>
```

**Process:**
1. Contribution directly reduces `loss_accum` first
2. Remaining amount goes to insurance fund balance
3. If `loss_accum` reaches 0, **exits withdrawal-only mode** automatically
4. Trading resumes once solvency is restored

**Example:**
```rust
// System in crisis: loss_accum = 5,000
engine.withdrawal_only == true

// Someone tops up 3,000
engine.top_up_insurance_fund(3_000)?;
// loss_accum now 2,000, still in withdrawal mode

// Another 2,000 top-up
let exited = engine.top_up_insurance_fund(2_000)?;
assert!(exited);  // Exits withdrawal mode
assert!(!engine.withdrawal_only);  // Trading resumes
```

#### Design Benefits

**Fairness:**
- All users lose same percentage of principal
- No first-mover advantage
- Transparent and deterministic

**Controlled Shutdown:**
- Prevents further risk-taking
- Allows orderly position unwinding
- Users can still close positions to reduce exposure

**Recovery Mechanism:**
- Clear path to restore solvency
- Economic incentive for insurance fund contributions
- Automatic return to normal operations

**Transparency:**
- Single flag indicates system state
- Clear loss amount (`loss_accum`)
- Predictable withdrawal amounts

#### Security Properties

**Invariants:**
- Total withdrawals in withdrawal-only mode ≤ `total_principal - loss_accum`
- All users receive same haircut percentage
- Principal tracking remains accurate despite withdrawals
- Conservation maintained throughout unwinding

**Attack Resistance:**
- No withdrawal order gaming (constant haircut ratio)
- No exploitation through position manipulation
- Clear separation of crisis vs normal operations

#### Test Coverage

7 comprehensive tests verify withdrawal-only mode behavior:
- Mode activation on insurance depletion
- Proportional haircut calculation
- Position closing allowed, opening blocked
- Deposits allowed and take proportional loss
- Insurance fund top-up reduces loss
- End-to-end fair unwinding scenario

See `tests/unit_tests.rs:1116-1374` for full test suite.

### 7. Funding Rates

**O(1) Perpetual Funding** with cumulative index pattern:

```rust
pub fn accrue_funding(
    &mut self,
    now_slot: u64,
    oracle_price: u64,
    funding_rate_bps_per_slot: i64,  // signed: + means longs pay shorts
) -> Result<()>
```

**How It Works:**

1. **Global Accrual (O(1)):**
   ```
   Δ F = price × rate_bps × dt / 10,000
   funding_index_qpb_e6 += ΔF
   ```
   - `funding_index_qpb_e6`: Cumulative funding index (quote per base, scaled by 1e6)
   - Updated once per slot, independent of account count

2. **Lazy Settlement (O(1) per account):**
   ```
   payment = position_size × (current_index - user_snapshot) / 1e6
   pnl_ledger -= payment
   user_snapshot = current_index
   ```
   - Settled automatically before any operation via `touch_user()`/`touch_lp()`
   - Called before: withdrawals, trades, liquidations, position changes

3. **Settle-Before-Mutate Pattern:**
   - **Critical for correctness:** Prevents double-charging on flips/reductions
   - `execute_trade()` calls `touch_user()` and `touch_lp()` first
   - Ensures funding applies to old position before update

**Example:**
```rust
// User has long position
user.position_size = 1_000_000;  // +1M base

// Accrue positive funding (+10 bps for 1 slot at $100)
engine.accrue_funding(1, 100_000_000, 10)?;
// Δ F = 100e6 × 10 × 1 / 10,000 = 100,000

// Settle funding
engine.touch_user(user_idx)?;
// payment = 1M × 100,000 / 1e6 = 100,000
// user.pnl_ledger -= 100,000  (long pays)

// Reduce position - funding settled FIRST
engine.execute_trade(&matcher, lp_idx, user_idx, price, -500_000)?;
// 1. touch_user() settles any new funding on remaining position
// 2. Then position changes to 500,000
```

**Invariants (Formally Verified):**

| ID | Property | Proof |
|----|----------|-------|
| **F1** | Funding settlement is idempotent | `tests/kani.rs:537` |
| **F2** | Funding never modifies principal | `tests/kani.rs:579` |
| **F3** | Zero-sum between opposite positions | `tests/kani.rs:609` |
| **F4** | Settle-before-mutate correctness | `tests/kani.rs:651` |
| **F5** | No overflow on bounded inputs | `tests/kani.rs:696` |

**Units & Scaling:**
- `oracle_price`: u64 in 1e6 (e.g., 100_000_000 = $100)
- `position_size`: i128 in base units (signed: + long, - short)
- `funding_rate_bps_per_slot`: i64 (10 = 0.1% per slot)
- `funding_index_qpb_e6`: i128 quote-per-base in 1e6

**Convention:**
- Positive funding rate → longs pay shorts
- Negative funding rate → shorts pay longs
- Payment formula: `pnl -= position × ΔF / 1e6`

**Key Design Choices:**
1. **Checked arithmetic** (not saturating) - funding is zero-sum, silent overflow breaks invariants
2. **No iteration** - scales to unlimited accounts
3. **Automatic settlement** - users can't dodge funding by avoiding touch operations
4. **Rate supplied externally** - separates mark-vs-index logic from risk engine

// Initialize risk engine
let params = RiskParams {
    warmup_period_slots: 100,                  // ~50 seconds at 400ms/slot
    maintenance_margin_bps: 500,               // 5%
    initial_margin_bps: 1000,                  // 10%

    liquidation_fee_bps: 50,                   // 0.5%
    insurance_fee_share_bps: 5000,             // 50% to insurance
    max_users: 1000,
    max_lps: 100,
    account_fee_bps: 10000,                    // 1% account creation fee
    max_warmup_rate_fraction_bps: 5000,        // 50% of insurance fund in T/2
};

let mut engine = RiskEngine::new(params);

// Add users and LPs (with account creation fees)
let alice = engine.add_user(10_000)?;  // Pay account creation fee
let lp = engine.add_lp(matching_program_id, matching_context, 10_000)?;

// Alice deposits
engine.deposit(alice, 10_000)?;

// Define a matcher (NoOpMatcher for tests, or custom implementation)
let matcher = NoOpMatcher;

// Alice trades (via matching engine)
engine.execute_trade(&matcher, lp, alice, 1_000_000, 100)?;

// Time passes...
engine.advance_slot(50);

// Alice can withdraw (warmed-up PNL is automatically converted to principal)
let withdrawable = engine.withdrawable_pnl(&engine.users[alice]);
engine.withdraw(alice, withdrawable)?;

// Liquidations (permissionless)
let keeper = engine.add_user(10_000)?;
engine.liquidate_user(alice, keeper, oracle_price)?;
```

## Design Rationale

### Why PNL Warmup?

Traditional perp DEXs face an impossible tradeoff:
1. **Fast withdrawals** → vulnerable to oracle attacks
2. **Delayed withdrawals** → poor UX

PNL warmup solves this by:
- Allowing instant withdrawal of **principal** (users can always exit with their deposits)
- Requiring time for **PNL** to vest (prevents instant extraction of manipulated profits)
- Using ADL to haircut young PNL during crises (aligns incentives)

### Why Principal is Sacred?

By guaranteeing that `principal` is never touched by socialization:
1. Users can withdraw their deposits (subject to margin requirements if they have open positions)
2. The worst case is losing unrealized PNL, not principal deposits
3. Creates clear mental model: "principal is protected from ADL, profits take time to vest"

**Important:** Users with open positions must maintain margin requirements. If you have a position and negative PNL, you may not be able to withdraw all principal until you close the position.

### Why Pluggable Matching Engines?

Different trading styles need different matching:
- **CLOB** (Central Limit Order Book): Traditional exchange UX
- **AMM** (Automated Market Maker): Instant execution
- **RFQ** (Request for Quote): OTC/large trades
- **Auction**: Fair price discovery

By separating matching from risk:
1. Risk engine focuses on safety
2. Matching engines focus on price discovery
3. LPs can choose their preferred matching model
4. No need to trust/whitelist matching engines (safety checks in place)

## Safety Properties

### What This Guarantees

✅ **User principal is protected from ADL** and withdrawable (subject to margin requirements)
✅ **PNL requires time T to become withdrawable**
✅ **ADL haircuts young PNL first, protecting principal**
✅ **Conservation of funds across all operations**
✅ **User isolation - one user can't affect another**
✅ **No oracle manipulation can extract funds faster than time T**
✅ **Fair unwinding in crisis - all users get same haircut percentage**
✅ **Clear recovery path via insurance fund top-ups**

### What This Does NOT Guarantee

❌ **Oracle is correct** (garbage in, garbage out)
❌ **Matching engine is fair** (LPs choose their matching engine)
❌ **Insurance fund is always solvent** (can be depleted in crisis)
❌ **Profits are guaranteed** (trading is risky!)

### Attack Resistance

| Attack Vector | Protection Mechanism |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Oracle manipulation | PNL warmup (time T) |
| Flash price attacks | Unrealized PNL not withdrawable |
| ADL abuse | Principal never touched |
| Matching engine exploit | User signature + solvency checks |
| Liquidation griefing | Permissionless + keeper incentives |
| Insurance drain | Fees replenish fund |
| Withdrawal order gaming | Fair unwinding with constant haircut ratio |
| Crisis exploitation | Withdrawal-only mode blocks new risk |

### Using as a Dependency

Add to your Solana program's `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
percolator = { git = "https://github.com/aeyakovenko/percolator", branch = "clean" }
```

Then import and use the risk engine:

```rust
use percolator::{RiskEngine, RiskParams, UserAccount};

// Initialize risk engine with your parameters
let params = RiskParams {
    warmup_period_slots: 100,
    maintenance_margin_bps: 500,
    // ... other params
};

let mut engine = RiskEngine::new(params);
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER ⚠️**

This code is an **experimental research project** and is **NOT production ready**:

- ❌ **NOT independently audited** - No professional security audit has been performed
- ❌ **NOT battle-tested** - Has not been used in production environments
- ❌ **NOT complete** - Missing critical production features (proper oracle integration, signature verification, etc.)
- ❌ **NOT safe for real funds** - Should only be used for educational and research purposes

**Do NOT use this code with real money.** This is a proof-of-concept demonstrating formally verified risk engine design patterns for educational purposes only.

For security issues or questions, please open a GitHub issue.

## Acknowledgments

This design builds on the formally verified model from the original Percolator project, simplified and focused exclusively on the risk engine component.
