//! GRIEFING-ECONOMICS lens harness for dcccrypto/percolator PR #135.
//!
//! Scenario under test: an asset side is in DrainOnly with a *dust* amount of
//! residual open interest held by a single over-collateralised account that
//! simply declines to close. Question: does the group-wide
//! `bankruptcy_hlock_active` gate (which the wrapper uses to block
//! WithdrawBackingBucket / WithdrawBackingBucketEarnings / WithdrawInsuranceAsset
//! for EVERY domain in the group) stay engaged forever, and can anyone force the
//! holder out?
//!
//! Written to compile against BOTH f53be74a (deployed) and dc41fca9 (PR head)
//! so the same file measures the marginal change.
//!
//! CITE REF. Every `src/v16.rs:N` below is a line number at the fork's `2c38570a` — the
//! loop base this file's fixture repair (AS-03) was measured at, and the ref whose `src/`
//! tree is byte-identical to this branch's base. Four cites in this file were still legacy
//! `f53be74a`/`dc41fca9` numbers and were re-pointed in AS-04:
//!   `:9918`        -> `:19282-19296`  (`try_clear_bankruptcy_hlock_if_healthy`)
//!   `:9931`        -> `:13934-13938`  (`certified_liq_deficit`)
//!   `:12618`       -> `:17637-17638`  (liquidation's zero-deficit NonProgress gate)
//!   `:12530-12557` -> `:17530-17582`  (`reduce_matching_open_interest_for_unilateral_close`)
//!
//! ASSERTIONS. Until AS-04, five of the seven tests here asserted nothing about the engine:
//! they only `println!`ed, so they passed under `--features audit-scan` while running on a
//! fixture the audit validator REJECTED, and three of them were printing a FALSE answer
//! (`liquidating_a_broke_holdout_releases_the_group_hlock` printed `Err(NonProgress)` purely
//! because the hand-written one-sided book made `unilateral_close_capacity` zero). AS-03
//! repaired the fixture; AS-04 gives each of those five a real assertion, every one derived
//! from a cited engine line rather than from what the test happens to print.
