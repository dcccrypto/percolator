//! test(#143) — a stressed junior winner cannot drain a funded senior.
//!
//! Issue #143 ("auto-minted provider backing → junior-profit seniority bypass")
//! describes a winner, paid out of a settled loser's recycled principal (which the
//! engine books as `source_fresh_backing`), extracting nominal profit ahead of the
//! insurance / socialized-loss stack under total stress (`residual == 0`).
//!
//! The mechanism is present — a winner with source claims realizes support via the
//! source path (`account_source_realizable_support`), which does not apply the
//! `residual()` haircut the non-source branch applies — but it is INERT, held closed
//! by two structural invariants:
//!
//!   1. `validate_header_aggregate_totals` checks `c_tot + insurance + earnings <=
//!      vault` FIRST, then adds `source_fresh_backing` as the most-junior claim — so
//!      the recycled loser principal is subordinate to insurance, at every mutator.
//!   2. a winner realizes only backing-limited support, so under `residual == 0` it
//!      cannot reach atoms that back a funded senior.
//!
//! These tests pin that property. What they actually catch was MEASURED by mutation,
//! not assumed, because a tripwire nobody has seen fire is not a tripwire:
//!
//!   * the fixture genuinely reaches #143's mechanism — a `panic!` probe inside
//!     `account_source_realizable_support` fires in ALL THREE tests, each with
//!     `face_claim = 900_000`, the winner's exact nominal gain;
//!   * inverting the seniority boundary — forcing
//!     `consume_validated_account_source_credit_not_atomic` down its insurance branch
//!     instead of the counterparty-backing branch — turns
//!     `stressed_winner_cannot_drain_funded_senior` RED (`close_resolved errored:
//!     LockActive`). That branch, not the two invariants named above, is where the
//!     seniority decision is actually taken, and it IS pinned here;
//!   * invariant 1 is a DETECTOR, not a barrier. Deleting the `source_fresh_backing`
//!     stage of `validate_header_aggregate_totals` leaves all three tests green,
//!     because relaxing a validator cannot by itself move an atom. It would stop the
//!     engine noticing a drain; it cannot cause one, so no end-state test can bite on it;
//!   * invariant 2's backing limit is NOT pinned at these numbers. Making
//!     `account_source_realizable_support` return `face_claim` in full also leaves all
//!     three green, because the loser's recycled principal (900_000) exactly backs the
//!     winner's face claim (900_000) — the haircut is non-binding in this fixture.
//!     A case with the loser's loss SMALLER than the winner's gain would pin it; owed.
//!
//! Everything is driven through REAL engine mutators — deposit, the matched
//! trade, the permissionless Refresh crank (which crashes the mark and settles
//! lazily), deposit_domain_insurance, resolve, and close_resolved. No pnl / capital /
//! backing / insurance field is hand-poked.
//!
